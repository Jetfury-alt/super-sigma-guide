            First thing to do when you start a playthrough is to start mining wood using your axe. Do it enough to collect about one hundred.
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->
        <p>
            A few acorns will also drop, they are used to grow more trees. If you want to, place the acorns down onto the ground, making sure there are more than 2 tiles from both sides of the plant for it to grow.

        <p>
            With your wood collected, go to your crafting section in your inventory, where you can scroll up and down until you can craft a Workbench. Or you can press the hammer icon to find the whole list of craftables:
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->

            Craft workbench and place it down by dragging it to your desired place and clicking. It is very recommended that you try to upgrade your weapon as soon as possible by crafting a wooden sword, the copper short sword is just terrible.
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->
        <p>
            To bring an item to the trash or delete it, hold Control on the keyboard, hovering over the items you want to delete.

            <u>Supa fire tip form Lionel</u><!-- The “<u>” tag renders text as underlined. -->: It is advised that you should NOT throw away your copper shortsword, as it is the main component to craft the most powerful weapon in the game, the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Zenith">Zenith</a> <!-- The “<a>” tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link one page to another. -->. It can also help that few minutes of getting the sword again (and maybe have some sentimental value as well, as it is your first weapon).
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->
        <p>
            You can also favourite an item by holding the Alt key on your keyboard. Favoriting items prevents that item from trashing, moving, selling or stacking. It is recommended for you to do this to your main weapons and tools.

            To make this bossfight easier, I highly recommend going to the underground jungle in search of finding ivy chests for an Anklet of the Wind.

            This can be combined along with an Aglet from surface chests and your Spectre Boots to create some really good boots:

            Head to your underground jungle and start looking for Man Eaters and Hornets or Spiked Jungle Slimes which drop vine and stingers respectively. Kill enough to gather 3 vines and 12 stingers.

            When fighting Skeletron, watch out for it spinning its head, as it deals a lot of damage. Also take out his arms first. If possible, try using the blade of grass on skeletron as it deals a lot more damage.
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->

            Once Skeletron is defeated, you will gain safe access to the dungeon and a new NPC.

            Once you are in the dungeon, open up as many pots and chests as possible. Some chests in the dungeon are locked chests, meaning you will have to get a golden key.

            The next and last boss of Pre-hardmode is Walls of Flesh, who upon defeating will trigger the transition into Hardmode (or as they say, "the release of the ancient spirits of light and dark").

            <u>Supa fire tip from Lionel</u><!-- The “<u>” tag renders text as underlined. -->: Note that the crimson will spread significantly faster in Hardmode, so keep an eye out and control it by buying purification powder from the Dryad or a Clentaminator from the Steampunker.

            If you have not already, use gravitation potions in order to explore the floating islands, or do anything you want to do before hardmode (e.g. stacking up on potions, upgrading arena and base, etc.) as it will get a lot more difficult than you think.

            To summon the boss, kill a voodoo demon. Upon death it drops a voodoo doll of the guide, which then would be dropped into lava to summon it.

            Dropping the doll into lava actually kills your guide. So if the boss isn't spawning, check to see of your guide has moved back in again.

            Obviously, The Night's Edge does not struggle against Wall of Flesh whatsoever. If you want to keep your distance, a Hellwing bow obtained from shadow chests would also be very good as well.
