            Terraria is one of the most popular games of all time, with 44 million copies sold to date, so that's why you've probably gotten a hold of one. Even if you have it on your PC or mobile, my near-complete guide will suit all, as it will cover the mechanics of the game and the interface as well.

            When you open up your Terraria game, you will be greeted with a Menu screen and it's music, named “Journey's Beginning” just like this:

            Once you've started playing as a single player, you have the option to add or select a character (Characters except Journey in terraria are not exclusive to one world only, so you can use the same character for different worlds), feel free to customize your character's looks, as you can't change it much after, although you can make a new one if you change your mind.

            Here are the different types of character difficulties. For your games, and most in the future, you would want to choose classic, where your character only drops money on death. There are also other difficulties, such as:
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->
        <ul> <!-- The “<ul>” tag defines an unordered list (ones marked with a bullet dot). -->
            <li>
                <strong>Mediumcore</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: You drop items upon death (trust me, you'll die a lot in this game, it's not Minecraft).
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
            <li>
                <strong>Hardcore</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: Your character and world playing is deleted upon death.
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
            <li>
                <strong>Journey</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: Intended to be a “creative” or “tourist” mode, where you have the power to easily acquire the many items in Terraria by duplication.
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have completed creating your character, go press the Play button located right under your character's preview window:
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->

        <hr> <!-- The “<hr>” tag displays a horizontal rule to separate content. -->
        <p>
            Once pressing play, you are prompted to create or select a world, go press the New button to open up the creation menu for your world:

            There are three different option categories of customise from:
        </p> <!-- The “<p>” tag defines a paragraph of text. -->
        <ul> <!-- The “<ul>” tag defines an unordered list (ones marked with a bullet dot). -->
            <li>
                <strong>World Size</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: For your world, which is a single player world, small is best. Medium and Large are acceptable, but are much more tedious to traverse.
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
            <li>
                <strong>World Difficulty</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: This is the difficulty that determines how difficult enemies are. Classic is to be used for your playthrough, Expert Mode is much more difficult with better loot and Master Mode is extremely difficult. Journey Mode worlds are to only be used with Journey mode characters.
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
            <li>
                <strong>Type of Evil Biome</strong><!-- The “<strong>” tag emphsises text by rendering it bolded. -->: From a distance, evil biomes seem like no good, and they are. They spread and try to infect your world and the monsters spawning. For this guide, the Crimson will be covered, but choosing Corruption instead will just change the enemies and loot associated in that evil biome.
            </li> <!-- The “<li>” tag defines a list item. -->
